The idea is to make an application that tracks Sports Players performance on the field using GPS tracking devices on each player.

The collected data will be stored in a Database, according to the team and player.

A management interface will be prepared to manage teams, players and matches.

Reporting of statistical info previously colleted will be prepared to analayze players performances.
